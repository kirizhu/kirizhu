# Who am I? ðŸ¤“
An It enthusiast and life long learner, constantly looking for new challenges and ways to improve my skills. I have a 2 year polytechnic degree in Applications Development where the main focus was Java/Swift for the Android/iOS platforms. I've done 6 months internship with a Swedish startup named Tiptapp where I mainly worked with React Native. And most recently I complete an onsite Full stack JavaScript Bootcamp at School of applied technologies(SALT) where we worked a lot with technologies such as react, react native, redux as well as express, mongoDB and REST in a Node environment. All while practicing git, TDD, mob programming and agile work methods.
