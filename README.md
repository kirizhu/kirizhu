# Who am I? ðŸ¤“
I'm a mobile app developer, currently working for a company that delivers live stream applications for its customers. Other than that I'm an IT enthusiast and life long learner, constantly looking for new challenges and ways to improve my skills. I have a 2 year polytechnic degree in Applications Development where the main focus was Java/Swift for the Android/iOS platforms. I've done 6 months internship with a Swedish startup named Tiptapp where I mainly worked with React Native. And most recently I complete an onsite Full stack JavaScript Bootcamp at School of applied technologies(SALT) where we worked a lot with technologies such as react, react native, redux as well as express, mongoDB and REST in a Nodejs environment. All while practicing git, TDD, mob programming and agile work methods.
