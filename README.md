# Who am I? ðŸ¤“
Iâ€™m a Mobile App Developer with a passion for creating efficient, user-friendly, and scalable cross-platform applications. Over the past 5 years, Iâ€™ve gained extensive experience working with React Native, TypeScript, and modern development practices, delivering high-quality solutions for iOS and Android platforms.

My journey began with a 2-year Polytechnic Degree in Application Development, focusing on Java and Swift, followed by a 6-month internship at Tiptapp, where I built my foundation in React Native. I later completed a Fullstack JavaScript Bootcamp at SALT, deepening my knowledge in React, Node.js, Redux, and MongoDB, all while practicing Agile methodologies, TDD, and mob programming.
